# MeetCode - A LeetCode Clone Project

## Introduction

MeetCode is a coding platform inspired by LeetCode, designed to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills and
prepare for technical interviews.

The objective of the system was to allow administrators to input model answer for programming problems, while students
could submit their solutions. The system automatically evaluated the correctness of these submissions.

## Highlights

### 1. Java for Logic and Data Management:

The core logic and data management are handled using Java, ensuring efficient processing and manipulation of user
submissions.

### 2. Spring Boot:

Implemented RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, providing a robust framework for seamless communication between the frontend
and backend.

### 3. Advanced Algorithms:

Employed advanced algorithms to validate the correctness of the code submitted by students, ensuring high accuracy in
feedback and assessments.

### 4. User Authentication and Security:

Integrated Firebase for user authentication, enhancing security and simplifying user management, allowing for a smooth
onboarding experience.

### 5. Responsive Front-End with ReactJS:

Used ReactJS to build an interactive and responsive user interface. Implemented resizable tabs that allow users to view
coding questions and their code simultaneously on the same page, enhancing the overall user experience.

### 6. Testing with JUnit:

Utilized JUnit Test standalone launcher for comprehensive testing of the applicationâ€™s functionality, ensuring
reliability and performance.
